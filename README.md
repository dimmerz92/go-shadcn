# shadcn for Go

**Before anything**, the shadcn team has nothing to do with this repo, this is purely a port of shadcn for Go in Templ.

## Why?

Well quite simply.. I suck at designing user interfaces and experiences. I like my backend, but occasionally need to add user interfaces so users can actually interact with my stuff.

Why would I reinvent the wheel when there are a tonne of great UI/UX libraries in existence?

shadcn is both popular and modular, the only problem, it's primarily designed for JavaScript/TypeScript and their associated frameworks. That means users from other languages are excluded, hence the reason for this port.

Plus, I also got bored and wanted to do something?

## Further info

More details, documentation, and usage information will be added to the README as the project becomes a little more fleshed out.
